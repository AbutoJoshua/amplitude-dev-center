Amplitude supports assigning users to groups and performing queries, such as Count by Distinct, on those groups. If at least one member of the group has performed the specific event, then the count includes the group.

For example, you want to group your users based on what organization they're in by using an 'orgId'. Joe is in 'orgId' '10', and Sue is in 'orgId' '15'. Sue and Joe both perform a certain event. You can query their organizations in the Event Segmentation Chart.

When setting groups, define a `groupType` and `groupName`. In the previous example, 'orgId' is the `groupType` and '10' and '15' are the values for `groupName`. Another example of a `groupType` could be 'sport' with `groupName` values like 'tennis' and 'baseball'.

 Setting a group also sets the `groupType:groupName` as a user property, and overwrites any existing `groupName` value set for that user's groupType, and the corresponding user property value. `groupType` is a string, and `groupName` can be either a string or an array of strings to indicate that a user is in multiple groups.
