---

Tracking page views will let you record whenever a user sees a page of your website, along with any properties about the page. Tracking page views is only available in Segment, and in most cases, we recommend that you track page views as an event.

### Adding Page Properties

Page properties are included every time a `page()` call is made. For example, you can include the following properties:

- path
- referrer
- search
- title
- url
