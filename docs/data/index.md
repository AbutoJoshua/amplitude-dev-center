# Data Overview

This is where I'd add a bunch of introductory content to make it clear what Data is, and what you need to know before you proceed.

Here's a flowchart

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A[Start] --> B{Error?};
  B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...];
  C --> D[Debug];
  D --> B;
  B ---->|No| E[Yay!];
```

1. :man_raising_hand: I'm an annotation! I can contain `code`, __formatted
    text__, images, ... basically anything that can be expressed in Markdown.
