title: Using the Tracking Library
description: The tracking library generated by `ampli pull` is used to track events from your apps and services. The library wraps your analytics providers' own libraries (e.g. Amplitude's or Segment's) and exposes a convenient, strongly-typed API for your company's analytics events. It also validates that your events match their definitions in your tracking plan before passing on clean, correct data over to each provider.

The tracking library generated by `ampli pull` is used to track events from your apps and services. The library wraps your analytics providers' own libraries (e.g. Amplitude's or Segment's) and exposes a convenient, strongly-typed API for your company's analytics events. It also validates that your events match their definitions in your tracking plan before passing on clean, correct data over to each provider.

Unlike other static tracking libraries you might have used in the past, Amplitude Data's tracking library is generated on-the-fly to match your tracking plan precisely. This means that instead of tracking events like this:

```java
JSONObject props = new JSONObject();
props.put("name", "Moto 360");

OldLibrary.trackEvent(
  "Product Viewed",
  props
);
```

You track them like this:

```java
ampli.productViewed(
  name = "Moto 360"
)
```

No more typos, forgotten properties, and boilerplate code. Amplitude Data is like auto-complete for your analytics.

## Destinations

The Ampli SDK sends events to Amplitude out of the box. If you would like to send data to other analytics destinations,
 you can create a custom [middleware](middleware-overview.md).
