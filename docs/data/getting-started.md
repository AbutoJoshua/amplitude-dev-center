## Iteratively Overview

Iteratively helps companies define, track, and verify their product analytics. It ensures analytics events are captured correctly and consistently across all teams and platforms, and enables teams to use their analytics with no need for cleanup or worrying about data integrity and trustworthiness. 

For PMs, data analysts, and other data consumers, Iteratively provides an always up-to-date Tracking Plan for the entire company. It replaces ad-hoc spreadsheets and wiki pages with one centralized Tracking Plan app. It minimizes turnaround time with engineering when adding and changing events, and enforces taxonomy standards and conventions across all teams.

For developers, Iteratively provides a toolkit that simplifies and accelerates the process of instrumenting analytics across one or more products. It automatically generates a type-safe tracking library according to the latest spec, lints code to make sure analytics events are tracked correctly, and exposes a unified API that removes the need to understand the ins and outs of each analytics provider.

Iteratively works with all popular [analytics providers](/using-the-tracking-library#destinations) (e.g. Segment, Amplitude, Custom Destinations), all popular [developer platforms](/using-the-tracking-library#sources) (e.g. JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Objective C, Swift, Kotlin, C#) and requires no infrastructure changes to your analytics pipeline.
