Welcome to Amplitude Experiment! We are delighted to help you start using feature flags for progressive delivery and product experimentation. It only takes a few minutes to get started with Amplitude and implement your first feature flag.

Setting up Amplitude Experiment
The first step to getting started is to define your deployments in Amplitude Experiment's user interface. Next, use the key from your deployment to implement an SDK or REST API. Finally, create your first feature flag or experiment flag!
